notes: |
  BMad Method - Brownfield Track
  
  This project has existing code and is using the full BMad Method with:
  - Documentation phase (analyze current codebase)
  - Research workflow (understand system)
  - Full planning cycle (PRD, Architecture, Epics/Stories)
  - Implementation readiness gate
  - Sprint planning for execution
  
  Next Workflow: document-project (Analyst phase)
  This prerequisite analyzes your existing codebase and documents it.
