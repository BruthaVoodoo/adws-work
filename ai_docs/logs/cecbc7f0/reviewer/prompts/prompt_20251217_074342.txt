# Review Implementation Against Specification

You are a comprehensive implementation reviewer. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the current implementation against the provided specification and identify any discrepancies, issues, or areas for improvement.

## Review Process

1. **Read the Specification**: Carefully review the specification file to understand the requirements
2. **Examine Implementation**: Analyze the current codebase to see what has been implemented
3. **Identify Issues**: Compare implementation against specification and identify any issues
4. **Capture Screenshots**: Take screenshots of critical functionality for documentation
5. **Categorize Issues**: Classify each issue by severity level
6. **Provide Resolutions**: Suggest specific steps to resolve each issue

## Input Parameters
- **ADW ID**: cecbc7f0
- **Specification File**: /Users/t449579/Desktop/DEV/ADWS/ai_docs/specs/chore/DAI-46-cecbc7f0-plan.md
- **Reviewer Agent**: reviewer

## Issue Severity Levels

- **blocker**: Critical issues that prevent the feature from working as specified
- **tech_debt**: Issues that affect code quality, maintainability, or performance
- **skippable**: Minor issues or suggestions that could be addressed later

## Output Format

You must return your review results as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "review_issues": [
    {
      "review_issue_number": integer,
      "screenshot_path": "string (path to screenshot file, empty if none)",
      "issue_description": "string (detailed description of the issue)",
      "issue_resolution": "string (specific steps to resolve the issue)",
      "issue_severity": "blocker|tech_debt|skippable",
      "screenshot_url": null
    }
  ],
  "screenshots": ["string (list of screenshot paths for overall review)"],
  "screenshot_urls": []
}
```

## Review Guidelines

1. **Be Thorough**: Check all aspects of the implementation against the specification
2. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed descriptions and actionable resolution steps
3. **Use Screenshots**: Capture visual evidence when issues are UI-related or complex
4. **Prioritize Correctly**: Use severity levels appropriately - blockers should only be used for critical functional issues
5. **Success Criteria**: Set success to `true` only if there are no blocker issues
