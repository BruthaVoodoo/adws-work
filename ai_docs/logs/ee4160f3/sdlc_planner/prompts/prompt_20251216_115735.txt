# Agent Chore Planning

Create a new plan to resolve a chore in an AI agent using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan and use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right areas.

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: You're writing a plan to resolve a chore in an AI agent that will add value to the agent's codebase (e.g., refactoring, dependency updates, architecture improvements).
- IMPORTANT: The `Chore` describes the chore that will be resolved. Remember we're not resolving the chore, we're creating the plan that will be used to resolve the chore based on the `Plan Format` below.
- You're writing a plan to resolve a chore. It should be simple but thorough and precise so we don't miss anything or waste time with any second round of changes.
- Create the plan in the `ADW/ai_docs/specs/chore/` directory with filename: `45-ee4160f3-plan.md`
- Use the plan format below to create the plan.
- Research the codebase and put together a plan to accomplish the chore.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to accomplish the chore.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the plan and the steps to accomplish the chore.
- Respect the agent framework being used (Strands Agents with Amazon AgentCore).
- Start your research by reading the `README.md` file.

## Relevant Files

Focus on the following files:
- `README.md` - Contains the agent overview and instructions.
- `agent/**` - Contains the agent implementation code.
- `handlers/**` - Contains the agent handlers and tools.
- `tests/**` - Contains the agent tests.
- `config/**` - Contains the agent configuration files.
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` - Contains the dependencies.

Ignore all other files in the codebase.

## Placeholder Reference

The following placeholders will be replaced with actual Jira issue context:
- `DAI-45` - The Jira issue key (e.g., "DAI-4")
- `Update README with current date for system testing.` - The issue title/summary
- `  *Story Format*

* As a developer, I want to update the README with today's date, so that I can perform a quick end-to-end test of the ADW system.

  *Acceptance Criteria*

* The {{README.md}} file is updated to include "Last updated: December 16, 2025".
* The change is committed to a new branch generated by ADW.
* A Pull Request is successfully created on Bitbucket by ADW for the change.

  *Traceability To Epic*

* Epic: ADW Core - System Maturation and Feature Enhancement (Jira Issue #: [ADW-XXX - Placeholder])

  *Optional (Recommended)*

* One sentence on business value
** Validates the end-to-end Plan -> Build -> Test -> Review workflow of the ADW system with a trivial change.` - The full issue description with requirements
- `` - Comma-separated labels associated with the issue
- `To Do` - Current state of the issue (e.g., "In Progress")

## Plan Format

```md
# Chore: <chore name>

## Chore Description
<describe the chore in detail>

## Relevance to Agent Framework
<explain how this chore relates to maintaining the Strands Agents implementation or Amazon AgentCore compatibility>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to resolve the chore:

<find and list the files that are relevant to the chore and describe why they are relevant in bullet points. If there are new files that need to be created to accomplish the chore, list them in an h3 'New Files' section.>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to accomplish the chore. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required to accomplish the chore then move on to the specific changes required to accomplish the chore. Your last step should be running the `Validation Commands` to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.>

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the chore is complete with zero regressions. every command must execute without errors so be specific about what you want to run to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions. Don't validate with curl commands.>

- `pytest tests/ -v` - Run all agent tests to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes or context that are relevant to the chore that will be helpful to the developer>
```
