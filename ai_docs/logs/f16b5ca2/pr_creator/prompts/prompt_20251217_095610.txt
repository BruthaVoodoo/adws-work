# Pull Request Generation

Generate a pull request title and description for the completed work.

**CRITICAL: Your ENTIRE response must be ONLY a valid JSON object. NO markdown, NO code blocks, NO explanations.**

## JSON Object Requirements

Create a JSON object with exactly these two fields:
- "title" - A concise PR title (max 80 characters)
- "description" - A detailed description explaining the changes

The description must include:
- Summary of what was implemented
- Link to the Jira issue: DAI-50
- Link to the plan file: /Users/t449579/Desktop/DEV/ADWS/ai_docs/specs/chore/DAI-50-f16b5ca2-plan.md
- Key technical decisions

## Context

- Branch Name: chore-issue-50-adw-f16b5ca2-add-readme-verification-comment
- Jira Issue: DAI-50
- Plan File: /Users/t449579/Desktop/DEV/ADWS/ai_docs/specs/chore/DAI-50-f16b5ca2-plan.md
- Workflow ID: f16b5ca2

## Valid Output Example

{"title": "DAI-4: Implement Strands SDK core for DummyAgent", "description": "Implements Strands Agent SDK core functionality for DummyAgent with Amazon AgentCore support.\\n\\nChanges:\\n- Replaced dummy Agent class with Strands SDK Agent\\n- Added Bedrock model provider configuration\\n- Integrated tool framework\\n- Added proper event loop and streaming\\n\\nLinks:\\n- JIRA Issue: DAI-4\\n- Implementation Plan: ADW/ai_docs/specs/feature/DAI-4-plan.md"}

## Absolute Rules

1. Response MUST be valid JSON object only - no markdown, no backticks, no explanation text
2. Start with { and end with }
3. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters
4. Title must be under 80 characters
5. Description should be useful for code reviewers
6. Always include the issue number and plan file path in the description
7. Do NOT wrap response in markdown code blocks
8. Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON object
