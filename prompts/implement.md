# Implement Agent Plan
Follow the `Instructions` to implement the `Plan` then `Report` the completed work.

## Instructions
- Read the plan file provided in PLAN_PATH, think hard about the plan and implement the plan.
- Execute every step in the "Step by Step Tasks" section of the plan in order, top to bottom.
- Before executing each step, print a clear header: "Step X: [Step Title]".
- Make sure to run all validation commands at the end to confirm the implementation is complete.
- If you encounter any issues, think through them carefully and adjust the implementation as needed.
- **DO NOT** commit your changes. The system will handle the final commit in a later phase. Leave all changes as modified files on the file system.

## Plan
Read and implement the plan from the following:
${input:plan:Paste path to the plan file here}

## Report

- Confirm all validation commands passed
- Include any notes about the implementation
